## Schema

### Introduction

- Schema refers to the structure of your database tables, including column types, sizes, and attributes. 
- Three guiding principles in mind when choosing a data type:
    - Pick the smallest data type that will hold all of your data.
    - Pick the simplest column type that accurately reflects your data.
    - Ensure your schema accurately reflects the reality of your data.
- The most common data types in MySQL:
    - `INT`: Used for integer values.
    - `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE`: Used for decimal or floating point values.
    - `VARCHAR`: Used for variable-length character strings.
    - `DATE`, `DATETIME` and `TIMESTAMP`: Used for date and time values.
